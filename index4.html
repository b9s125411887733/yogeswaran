    <h3><p>Keystroke Injection</h3>
        Computers trust humans. Humans use keyboards. Hence the universal spec — HID, or Human Interface Device.</br>
        
        A keyboard presents itself as a HID, and in turn it's inherently trusted as human by the computer.</br>
        
        The USB Rubber Ducky — which looks like an innocent flash drive to humans — abuses this trust to deliver powerful payloads, injecting keystrokes at superhuman speeds.</p>
